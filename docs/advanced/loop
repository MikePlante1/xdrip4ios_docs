# Loop Integration

Loop has the ability to eavesdrop on Dexcom transmissions, so you just need to [enter your Transmitter ID into Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/loop-3/add-cgm/#add-cgm).

For Loop to use [certain Libre](../index.md#compatible-sensors)) as a cgm, however, you need to install a [plugin](https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/xdrip-client-swift-1#readme) into Loop 3 to allow it to use xDrip4iOS as a data source. You can also install the [main_lnl_patches](https://github.com/loopnlearn/LoopWorkspace/tree/main_lnl_patches) branch of Loop 3 maintained by [Loop and Learn](https://www.loopandlearn.org) which has this plugin already installed in it.

## What is Loop?

**Loop** is an **Artificial Pancreas System** (APS) written for the iPhone.

An APS works by reading blood glucose values, predicting/calculating the insulin requirement and automatically adjusting a user's insulin pump with the aim of keeping the user within their target blood glucose range.

___
## How do I install Loop?

You need to build Loop yourself using the directions at [LoopDocs.org](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/). There are two methods for building Loop, both of which are available at LoopDocs. Many 

Remember that xDrip4iOS is a separate app and must be [built from source](../install/build.md) in order to successfully interface with FreeAPS.

___
### Sign the Targets

As per a normal Loop build, you will need to sign the four targets using your Development Team.

Signing will automatically set the Bundle Identifier for your app. You can change this, but be aware that it will then install a completely new FreeAPS app. It's better to just leave it as is.
___
### App Group

Please do not modify the App Groups at all. This is important to ensure integration with xDrip4iOS.

___
## How do I install xDrip4iOS?

You need to follow the [Build From Source](../install/build.md) instructions.


The common LoopKit app group is already written into the standard project file in xDrip4iOS so no need to touch anything.

___
## Operation

The operation of both FreeAPS (Loop) and xDrip4iOS is the same. The only thing needed is to add a CGM in FreeAPS and chose "xDrip4iOS".

This will tell FreeAPS to look for glucose data in the shared app group via Julien's xdrip client.
